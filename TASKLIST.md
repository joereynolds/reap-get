- [x] Move 'temp_db' into json file
- [ ] Get basic user.conf file working. Including directory paths
- [ ] Add a default value to show all plugins in the packages.json if no arguments are supplied
- [ ] Add regular expressions to arguments (no idea how hard this'll be). i.e. A user can do reap-get -i s* (install all packages beginning with 's')
- [ ] In the future, when we have the web interface, we'll need to somehow approve packages before they go in the packages file
