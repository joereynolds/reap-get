#Contributing

If you would like to contribute to reap-get, fork the branch and submit a pull request!

## Workflow

reap-get follows the usual git workflow of most other projects.

- Fork the repo
- Clone your fork
- Create a branch for your changes
- Make your changes and make a pull request

## What should I work on?

- Write unit tests for reap-get as currently, there are none :O!
- Have a go at completing a task from the 'command-line' section of tasklist.md
- Test reap-get itself.
    - Are there any packages that download incorrectly?
    - Do all of reap-get's commands (--view, --install etc...) work as intended?
    - Does all of the information about the package come through correctly?

- Spread the word. This is a labour of love so please let other people know about if you
  think it would benefit them.
