Getting and setting up reap-get is simple.

# Note

reap-get is python3 only. I have no plans to move it towards python2.x.
This means that in order to run it, you will need to do
```
python3 reap-get.py --your-command
```
Instead of
```
python reap-get.py --your-command
```

## Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/joereynolds/reap-get.git
cd reap-get
``` 

## Use reap-get

### Windows users
Please run as administrator as reap-get needs to modify files

### Linux users
sudo
